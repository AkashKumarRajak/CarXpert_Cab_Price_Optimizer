# 🚖 CarXpert - Cab Price Optimizer

**CarXpert** is a smart, data-driven fare comparison and recommendation dashboard that helps users find the most affordable and available ride options (Car, Bike, Auto) in their city. Built using Python and Streamlit, CarXpert empowers users with real-time, actionable insights for choosing the best cab services from platforms like Ola, Uber, and Rapido.

CarXpert solves this problem by analyzing fare data and offering users the best transport option available — whether it’s a car, bike, or auto. This tool not only makes cab booking smarter but also saves users time and money.
